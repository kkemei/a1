We have some cool things happening that we want you to know about:
<ul>
	<li>this month you can purchase 3 drinks for the price of 2 at the bar.</li>
    <li>First-time party-goers get a 50% discount on entry</li>
    <li>If you get a costume custom made, your next party entry is free if you wear that costume.</li>
	<li>Wear your costume in to KFC on Stanton street and you can get a free drink with a 21-piece bucket. Tell them you’ve been to CossiePlay!</li>
</ul>
<p>Party Guidelines</p>
<p>
CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.
Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge. Alcohol is served at the bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be escorted to a taxi – paid by the party-goer.
